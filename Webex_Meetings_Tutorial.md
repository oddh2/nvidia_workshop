# Troubleshooting

- In case the link won't work for you these are the meeting credentials:
    - Meeting ID: 175 931 2922
    - Meeting Password: qMtFS2xxD76

- Windows: if your Audio and Camera aren't working. Please open your Windows Settings (Windows-Key + I) and head over to Privacy (dt: Datenschutz) > Microphone. And check if the **Allow apps to access your camera** field is checked. (Same for camera)
- You may need to restart the Cisco Meetings App afterwards
